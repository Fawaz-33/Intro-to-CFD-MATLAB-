# Intro-to-CFD-MATLAB-

The codes in this project are as of Intro to CFD course by Mr. Tanmay Agarwal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwGFw_TWZQA&list=PLKSR9A4mJH5rvt_Lf007xbmJISRWA0xYS) 
extra two files are added by modifying the original. 

The following codes are available here-
**1. 1D Diffusion eqn
  2. 2D Diffusion eqn
  3. 2D Diffusion eqn (Unsteady)
  4. 1D Convection Diffusion eqn
  5. 2D Convection Diffusion eqn
  6. 2D Convection Diffusion eqn (Upwind Scheme)
  7. 2D Convection Diffusion eqn (QUICK Scheme) [Extra Addition]
  8. Lid Driven Cavity (ACM method)
  9. Lid Driven Cavity (SIMPLE method)
  10. Channel flow (ACM method) [Extra Addition]**
